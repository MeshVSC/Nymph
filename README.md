### ‚ö†Ô∏è TEMPORARY ACCESS CONTROL SIMULATION
**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS:**
The current click behavior on the landing page is a **TEMPORARY SIMULATION** and must be removed/modified in the future:

- **StockSentry Card**: Currently the only functional card - clicking it makes other cards disappear and navigates to dashboard.html
- **Other Cards** (Spark, JstCode, Little Art Corner, BizSentry): Show an "Access Denied" popup when clicked
- **This behavior is NOT permanent** - it's only implemented to simulate a working application while other components are being developed
- **Future Implementation**: All cards should navigate to their respective applications when those are built

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open the landing page**
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your browser
   open index.html
   ```

2. **Or serve locally**
